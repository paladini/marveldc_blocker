# Marvel-DC Blocker
Chrome Extension that removes all Facebook posts that mention any shit from Marvel or DC universe. 

For unknown reasons (during my childhood and probably related to my parents), I don't like anything related to super heroes. I know that most of you like movies and comics about heroes from Marvel and DC - and I respect it, but I personally don't like it. I mean, I really don't like it. It make me feel angry. Very. Angry.

Summarizing, I don't want to see anything related to "Civil War", "#TeamIronMan", "#TeamCap" or any shitty post from Marvel / DC universe in my Facebook. If you neither, then download this extension and be happy :)

Heavily based on [this Chrome extension](https://github.com/derekstory/remove_donald_trump_chrome_extension).
